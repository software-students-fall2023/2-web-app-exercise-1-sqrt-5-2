## Setup

Copy the contents of `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file. If you want, you can edit the details accordingly.

### MongoDB
- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
- Start the MongoDB server in the same configuration as specified in `.env`.

### Environment

### Pipenv

To manage dependencies using Pipenv, check [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) for details.

Install Pipenv:

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pipenv install
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

> **Note:** If you are having issues using Pipenv, create virtual environment using venv, activate it and run:
>
> ```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

Finally, run the flask app using:

```sh
flask run --reload
```

or 

```sh
python app.py
```

### Filler Data

Filler data will be added automatically to the database if there is no data in the collections initially.

Run the following in the root directory if you need to manually add filler data to the database:

```sh
python -m scripts.fill
```
